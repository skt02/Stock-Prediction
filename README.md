# Stock-Prediction
This project uses the Yahoo Finance API to load in historical stock price data and uses various machine learning methods to make predictions about whether the stock will
rise, fall, and stay within a certain percentage of change - in this case 2%. The most accurate method found was the LSTM network used through the Keras library. Typical
training and testing was used for all methods.
